#1 Rewrite SQL generation to be OO.  This will involve generating a new,
   seperate module that just generates SQL.

* Look into adding all standard options not currently present to commands
* (perhaps only through the hash style params)

== Look into the ability to add proprietary options to commands
   Proprietary stuff should be documented away form the main
   documentation... or CLEARLY marked.
   Currently it is possible to do this sort of thing with the "extra"
   parameter, but I'm some what ambivalent about its merits.  It's not
   documented yet either (due to this ambivalence).
   * LIMIT functionality to "SELECT"
   * Other MySQL specific stuff (like insertid)
