There seems to be a bug involved in calling disconnect on cloned handles. 
That is, it doesn't seem to always happen.  I've encountered this in our
modperl project.  Right now my answer is to call disconnect explicitly
before destroying the object, but I don't like that answer.  When it is
fixed I'll move it up to 1.0.
